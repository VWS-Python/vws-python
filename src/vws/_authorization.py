    Return an `Authorization` header which can be used for a request made to

    See https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/Using-the-VWS-API.

    Args:
        access_key: A VWS server or client access key.
        secret_key: A VWS server or client secret key.
        method: The HTTP method which will be used in the request.
        content: The request body which will be used in the request.
        content_type: The `Content-Type` header which is expected by
            endpoint. This does not necessarily have to match the
            `Content-Type` sent in the headers. In particular, for the query
            API, this must be set to `multipart/form-data` but the header must
            include the boundary.
        date: The current date which must exactly match the date sent in the
            `Date` header.
        request_path: The path to the endpoint which will be used in the
            request.

    Returns:
        Return an `Authorization` header which can be used for a request made
        to the VWS API with the given attributes.
